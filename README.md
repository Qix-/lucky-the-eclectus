# Lucky the Eclectus ðŸ¦œ


Parrot owning simulator! Lucky the Eclectus Parrot likes to pop in once in a while and tell you what's on his mind.

Every so often, Lucky decides he has something to say. Let him keep you company!

Lucky has no commands and prefers to keep to himself. This is identical to real life (except for when it's his daddy). This is to simulate real life as close as possible.

Simply invite Lucky to your server and he'll do the rest.

## Background

Lucky is my male Aru Islands Eclectus parrot. He loves to talk, and many have asked me to somehow capture his thoughts in a broadcastable format. This is the quickest and easiest way for me to do so.

All of the phrases/actions lucky performs are 100% identical to what he does in real life, though I've cut the frequency by about 90% (to keep your server's spam down).

A few weeks ago, a friend suggested this bot be made, and since I've had a bit of free time lately I figured why not. So here we are.

Obligatory parrot tax:

## Privacy

_Lucky the Parrot_ has no commands (not unlike real life) and does not track any information, users, or messages. This is a "pet project", doing nothing more than what's advertised - sitting in your server and breaking the silence every so often.

Messages that are received are checked for the bot owner's user ID and discarded if it does not match. DM's are unprocessed. Channel and Guild (server) names are used only for logs and are not stored, processed, sold, etc.

Seriously, I'm just a dude who wanted his bird in bot form. I have no other motives or intentions.
